      "description": "**Date:** January 26, 2026\n**Focus:** Pre-New York Session & Weekly Outlook\n\n### 🚀 Your Engines\n\nThe Calm Before the Storm. We are sitting at a pivotal moment. Bitcoin is currently testing major support at a widespread $87,000 range as we head into a week loaded with high-impact economic data.\n\n### 📊 Technical Analysis: The Big Picture\n\nBased on the 15m, 1H and 4H charts provided:\n\n**Current Structure:** BTC is currently consolidating in a Defined Range ($87k - $93k). After a rejection from ~$93.6k, price has bled back down to the range lows.\n\n**The Good:** The bulls are actively defending the $87,190 - $87,500 zone. We are seeing long wicks on the 15m/1H charts (evidence of buying pressure) at this level.\n\n**The Bad:** We are below the mid-range and local trend is still bearish on the 4H. We haven't reclaimed previous support at $89k yet.\n\n**Key Levels to Watch:**\n- 🟢 Major Support (Buy Zone): $87,160 - $87,500 (Current region). If this holds, it's optimal R:R long entry.\n- Lower Support: $85,200 (Must-hold macro level if we flush).\n- 🔴 Localized Resistance (Take Profit): $88,922 - $89,600. This is the first hurdle.\n- Reclaiming this opens the door to $90k+.\n- Major Resistance: $91,700 - $93,600 (Range Highs).\n\n**GPS/Indicator Outlook:**\nYour charts show Green Buy Signals firing on lower timeframes (1H) at support. We are bouncing off the Golden Pocket of the local leg. Often, algorithms will force a bounce here to trap late shorts.\n\n### 📊 Probabilities & Scenarios\n\n**🟢 Bullish Scenario (60% Probability):**\nPrice sweeps the $87,100 lows one more time to grab liquidity, then rotates back up towards the mid-range.\n- **Trigger:** Reclaim of $88,000 with volume.\n- **Target:** $88,900 -> $90,500.\n\n**🔴 Bearish Scenario (40% Probability):**\nHigh timeframe consolidation fails. We lose $87k and flush into the $85k demand zone ahead of FOMC.\n- **Trigger:** A 1-Hour candle close below $87,100.\n- **Target:** $85,226.\n\n### 📅 Macro Events: What Will Move Markets\n\n**Expected Volatility:** This week is absolutely STACKED with Central Bank news. Expect fake-outs.\n\n**🇺🇸 MON (Today):** US Durable Goods Orders (Impact: Medium) - Watch for initial DXY reaction.\n\n**🇺🇸 WED (Jan 29):** FOMC STATEMENT & FED RATE DECISION (Impact: 💥 HIGH) - This is the main event. **Do not over-leverage before Wednesday afternoon.** Markets often chop-bleed into this event.\n\n**🇺🇸 THU (Jan 29):** ECB Interest Rate Decision (Impact: Medium/High).\n\n**🇺🇸 THU (Jan 30):** Jobless Claims.\n\n### 🎯 Action Plan for the Week\n\n**Do not chase breakdown shorts at $87k support.** The R:R favors a bounce play here or a wait-and-see.\n\n**Long Entry Idea:** Scale in at $87,200 - $87,500 with a tight stop loss below $86,900. Target $89k.\n\n**Short Entry Idea:** If price pumps to $89,600 and gets rejected, look for shorts targeting the lows again.\n\n**Watch for News:** Wednesday will likely invalidate standard technicals temporarily.\n\n**Be flat or low leverage going into the Fed announcement.** Trade the levels, not the noise! 🚀",
